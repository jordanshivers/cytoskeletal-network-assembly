Code for the paper **Tau-Driven Coordination of Microtubule-Actin Crosstalk in Cell-Sized Vesicles** by Mousumi Akter, Jordan L. Shivers, Liya Ding, Aaron R. Dinner, and Allen P. Liu.

*Under construction.*


To simulate fluid vesicles, we use the LAMMPS [pair_membrane](https://github.com/Saric-Group/BSS2024_LAMMPS_Task/tree/main/LAMMPS_installation/src) pair style developed by the [Šarić group](https://github.com/Saric-Group). This code implements the coarse grained particle-based membrane model described in [Yuan et al. 2010](https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.82.011905).

To install LAMMPS locally:

1. Run `clone_lammps.sh` to clone the LAMMPS repository to the current directory.
2. Run `build_lammps.sh` to build LAMMPS and copy the executable `lmp_mpi` to the current directory.
